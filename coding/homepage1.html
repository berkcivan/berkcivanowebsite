        <center><h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1></center>
  
        <p>To introduce myself, I'm Berk Civan. Besides my role as Marketing Associate at BCP Worldwide Inc, I am a full-time student at Fordham University in the Lincoln Center, where I am studying New Media & Digital Design with a Theatre and Spanish Minors. My favorite thing is to create visual contents on topics where everyone can relate. This online portfolio is meant to showcase my experience as an Turkish international student with Bulgarian immigrant roots in New York City, where I have the opportunity to gain a third-culture viewpoint.</p>
